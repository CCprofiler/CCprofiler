abstract = {Next-generation mass spectrometric (MS) techniques such as SWATH-MS have substantially increased the throughput and reproducibility of proteomic analysis, but ensuring consistent quantification of thousands of peptide analytes across multiple liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) runs remains a challenging and laborious manual process. To produce highly consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data matrices in an automated fashion, we developed TRIC (http://proteomics.ethz.ch/tric/), a software tool that utilizes fragment-ion data to perform cross-run alignment, consistent peak-picking and quantification for high-throughput targeted proteomics. TRIC reduced the identification error compared to a state-of-the-art SWATH-MS analysis without alignment by more than threefold at constant recall while correcting for highly nonlinear chromatographic effects. On a pulsed-SILAC experiment performed on human induced pluripotent stem cells, TRIC was able to automatically align and quantify thousands of light and heavy isotopic peak groups. Thus, TRIC fills a gap in the pipeline for automated analysis of massively parallel targeted proteomics data sets.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Data independent acquisition mass spectrometry has emerged as a reproducible and sensitive alternative in quantitative proteomics, where parsing the highly complex tandem mass spectra requires dedicated algorithms. Recently, targeted data extraction was proposed as a novel analysis strategy for this type of data, but it is important to further develop these concepts to provide quality-controlled, interference-adjusted and sensitive peptide quantification.

RESULTS:We here present the algorithm DIANA and the classifier PyProphet, which are based on new probabilistic sub-scores to classify the chromatographic peaks in targeted data-independent acquisition data analysis. The algorithm is capable of providing accurate quantitative values and increased recall at a controlled false discovery rate, in a complex gold standard dataset. Importantly, we further demonstrate increased confidence gained by the use of two complementary data-independent acquisition targeted analysis algorithms, as well as increased numbers of quantified peptide precursors in complex biological samples. Availability and implementation: DIANA is implemented in scala and python and available as open source (Apache 2.0 license) or pre-compiled binaries from http://quantitativeproteomics.org/diana. PyProphet can be installed from PyPi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyprophet). Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
