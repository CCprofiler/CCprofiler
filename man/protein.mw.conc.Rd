\title{A data.table that holds stores for each protein its molecular weight as
annotated in UniProt as well as an estimate on its absolute abundance within
the sample.
Its structure is as follows:
\itemize{
 \item \code{protein_id} The Uniprot identifier of the protein.
 \item \code{protein_mw} The molecular weight.
 \item \code{protein_concentration} The absolute concentration.
