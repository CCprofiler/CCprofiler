\title{Generate complex decoy hypotheses from target hypotheses and distance table.
Selects proteins by min_distance in the network.}
\usage{
generateComplexDecoys(target_hypothesis, dist_info, min_distance = 2,
  seed = 123, n.cores = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_hypothesis}{data.table in the format of complex hypotheses}

\item{dist_info}{data.table with three columns (x,y,dist) containing all possible combinations
of proteins and their shortest distance.
This is the output from calculatePathlength()}

\item{min_distance}{numeric minimum distance between to proteins to be able to be in same complex decoy}

\item{seed}{numeric seed for random number generator}

\item{n.cores}{numeric number of cores used for parallelization}
}
\value{
data.table with binary interactions between "a" and "b"
}
